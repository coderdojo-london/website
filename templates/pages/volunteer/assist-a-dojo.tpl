			<p>It doesn't matter if you're a veteran coder or have no technical experience, we're always looking for awesome volunteers to assist at a local Dojo!</p>
			<p>CoderDojo is an opportunity to inspire the next generation of digital makers by teaching them to code in a fun and sociable environment.</p>
			<p>At CoderDojo, ninjas learn to build apps, games, and websites. It makes learning to code a fun and sociable experience.</p>

			<p>Learning is led by the young people - there is no set curriculum. We encourage our volunteer mentors to share their knowledge in areas they are passionate about.</p>

			<p>CoderDojo is a great learning experience for our mentors as well the young people, many enjoy networking with other mentors and collaborating.</p>
