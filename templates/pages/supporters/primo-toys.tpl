					<p>Primo Toys is the leading purveyor of hands-on smart toys that introduce computer programming skills in early years. They are here to build a new standard in early learning and coding.</p>
					<p>They make smart, screen-less toys that introduce children to programming, powered by a unique programming language you can touch. These toys are specifically designed for children in pre-literate years and provide fun learning for curious minds with big imaginations.</p>
					<p>Their first product, Cubetto, is a playful wooden robot that helps girls and boys aged 3 and up in learning computer programming without screens or literacy, all over the world.</p>
					<p>Praised by Fast Company as "revolutionary", Cubetto is the most crowdfunded educational technology invention in Kickstarter's history, raising $2.4m from backers in 96 countries. Cubetto is powered by the first programming language you can touch, allowing children to learn and explore real programming through storytelling and hands-on play.</p>
