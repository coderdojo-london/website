			<h3>Curiosity, Creativity &amp; Collaboration through code.</h3>
			<p>The CoderDojo movement believes that an understanding of programming languages is increasingly important in the modern world, that it&#39;s both better and easier to learn these skills early, and that nobody should be denied the opportunity to do so.</p>
			<p>To that end, we&#39;ve built a global network of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs for young people. Anyone aged seventeen or younger can visit a Dojo where they can learn to code, build a website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment.</p>
			<p>CoderDojo organizes free coding workshops (called Dojo&#39;s) that is entirely prepared and led by volunteers. If you are older, then you can assist an existing Dojo or start your very own CoderDojo!</p>
			<p>Contributions from our awesome partners is always appreciated. They have been hard at work to create the best and most exciting resources for you to enjoy. There are games to be played, sushi cards to learn and even hardware to sync up to our favourite things.</p>
			<p>Let's now get out there and create magic.</p>
